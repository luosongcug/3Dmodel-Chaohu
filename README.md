3D velocity model beneath the Chao lake, eastern China

Hi, all.
We obtain a high-resolution 3-D shear-wave velocity model beneath the Chao lake, eastern China.
The format of CL3D.mod is "longitude(deg), latitude(deg), depth(km), Vs (km/s) Vp (km/s) density (g/cm^3)".
Note that the Vp and density are directly converted from Vs using empirical relations proposed by Brocher (2005).

More detail information on the 3-D model please refer:
